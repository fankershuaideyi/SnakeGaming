# SnakeGame

This snake game includes a single-player mode, a two-player mode, settings, and features about:
When running the game, it is recommended to use the IDE and to use cmd, please note that the encoding format is UTF-8.

**Single-player mode**: In single-player mode, the player has to move by "WASD" to achieve the goal of eating 20 food items, note that the player cannot hit himself or the border, otherwise the game is considered lost! In addition to this, I have added a relaxing and soothing music track to set the scene for a relaxing time.

**Two-player mode**: In two-player mode, player 1 uses "WASD" to move and "J" to shoot, and player 2 uses the arrow buttons to move and "1" to shoot: In two-player mode, I've added shooting and boundary reduction, where players need to eat eight objectives or survive to the end to the sound of tense music.

**Settings**: The player can modify the buttons to suit their needs, but the game will be incorrect if they are modified to the same buttons.

**About**: The player can get some basic information about the game here.
